                        GALAGA, released by Namco in 1986, is one of the most iconic shoot-'em-up games of all time. In this game, players control a spaceship at the bottom of the screen, shooting waves of alien enemies descending from the top of the screen.

                        The gameplay is simple but thrilling: players must avoid enemy fire while attempting to shoot down the alien ships. Some enemy ships can capture the player's spaceship, and it's up to the player to rescue it and continue the battle.
