                        TETRIS, created by Russian software engineer Alexey Pajitnov, is one of the most recognizable puzzle video games of all time. Released in 1984, TETRIS quickly became a sensation, spreading across the globe. The game's simplicity combined with its ever-increasing difficulty made it incredibly addictive.

                        The main gameplay mechanics are simple: falling blocks, called "tetrominoes", need to be arranged to create complete lines on the screen. When a line is filled with blocks, it disappears, and the player earns points. As the game progresses, the blocks fall faster, making it increasingly challenging to place them effectively.

                        TETRIS was initially available on computers, but it quickly made its way to every major gaming platform. Its ability to keep players hooked with its rhythmic gameplay and progressively more challenging levels made it a timeless classic. Despite its simple graphics, it offered a depth that few games could match.
