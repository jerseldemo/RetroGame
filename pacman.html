                    <p class="text-muted">
                        PAC-MAN, created by Namco in 1980, is one of the most iconic video games ever made. In the game, players control PAC-MAN, a yellow, circular character that must navigate a maze, eating pellets while avoiding four colorful ghosts. PAC-MAN was a revolutionary arcade game that shifted the focus away from shooting and toward maze navigation and strategy.

                        What set PAC-MAN apart from other arcade games of the time was its innovative gameplay and appeal to a broader audience, including women, who were not traditionally video game players. The game's simple but engaging mechanics and memorable characters have made it a cultural phenomenon.

                        As PAC-MAN moves through the maze, he must collect all the pellets to clear the level. Power Pellets give PAC-MAN the ability to temporarily turn the tables on the ghosts, allowing him to eat them for extra points. The game has no ending, as it loops with increasing difficulty, making it a timeless challenge.

                    <p class="text-muted">
                        PAC-MAN became an instant classic and is often credited with helping bring video games into the mainstream. It remains one of the best-selling video games of all time and is frequently referenced in pop culture, making PAC-MAN a staple of retro gaming.
